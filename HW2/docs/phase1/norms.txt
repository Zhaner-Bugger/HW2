Team Norms:
Actionable outcomes: Conclude each meeting with a summary of decisions made and a list of clear action items with assigned owners.

Code standards: Define and enforce a shared coding style, including formatting, naming conventions, and commenting. This ensures the codebase remains readable and consistent for everyone. Tools like linters and formatters can help automate this process.

Taking ownership: Team members are responsible for their assigned tasks from start to finish. If a commitment cannot be met, the team must be notified as soon as possible.

Attendance: All team members must attend the twice a week stand up meetings
